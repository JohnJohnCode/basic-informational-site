    <h1 class="header">What the heck is this?...</h1>
    <p class="para">...is what you are probably asking yourself. Well, let me tell ya - I am currently in the proccess
         of becoming a fullstack webdev by going through this little openshare community-driven course called 
         <a class="odinLink" href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. Now, in this course there 
         is a chapter dedicated to Node.js and this site just so happens to be the first project in that chapter. 
         Neat, right? Anyhow, you won't find much content on this website as that wasn't the goal of this 
         project, the goal was to create a website that runs on Node.js and you reading this is proof 
         that I have succeeded, hooray! Also, sorry that the page looks like crap, for now I don't possess the knowledge
          of linking static CSS files to my HTML without getting a 404 so for now this will have to do xd. P.S. 
          100% inline styling gives me conniptions so we shall do without it.
